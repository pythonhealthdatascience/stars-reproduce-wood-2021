```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from time_to_complete import process_times, success_static, success_interactive

# List of time to complete each item
time_list = [
    [170, 'Figure 4'],
    [170, 'Table 4'],
    [170, 'Figure 5'],
    [170, 'Figure 6'],
    [230, 'Figure 7']]
times_df = process_times(time_list)
```

Non-interactive plot:

```{python}
success_static(times_df)
```
