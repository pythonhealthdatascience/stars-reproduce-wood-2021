## Study

> Wood RM, Pratt AC, Kenward C, McWilliams CJ, Booton RD, Thomas MJ, Bourdeaux CP, Vasilakis C. **The Value of Triage during Periods of Intense COVID-19 Demand: Simulation Modeling Study**. *Medical Decision Making* 41(4):393-407 (2021). <https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989X21994035>.

This study uses discrete-event simulation to explore the deaths and life years lost under different triage strategies for an intensive care unit, relative to a baseline strategy. The unit is modelled with 20 beds (varied from 10 to 200 in sensitivity analyses). Three different triage strategies are explored, under three different projected demand trajectories.

## Computational reproducibility

Successfully reproduced **5 out of 5 (100%)** of items from the scope in **3h 50m (9.6%)**.

Required troubleshooting:

* **Environment** - identifying required packages and creating `renv`
* **File paths** - amending for imports and exports (although this was partly because I reorganised repository, and would always be necessary)
* **Syncing raw results file** - compress file and set up GitHub Large File Storage for the raw results
* **Correction to figure** - add smoothing to figure 7 code

<sup>Context: The original study repository was evaluated against criteria from journal badges relating to how open and reproducible the model is and against guidance for sharing artefacts from the STARS framework. The original study article and supplementary materials (excluding code) were evaluated against reporting guidelines for DES models: STRESS-DES, and guidelines adapted from ISPOR-SDM.</sup>
