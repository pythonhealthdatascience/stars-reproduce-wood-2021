Consensus on scope and archive the repository. Total time used: 1h 7m (2.8%)

## Untimed: Consensus on scope

Emailed the scope to Tom, who responded that he was happy with it. There was one section of the Discussion he highlighted as being unsure if it was covered:

"This is shown to reduce life-years lost by up to 12% from the ‘‘first-come, first-served’’ baseline, although the corresponding reduction in deaths is a modest 2.7%." @wood_value_2021

But we identified that it was captured in Figure 4.

## 15.38-15.47: Archive repository

Updated CHANGELOG, set up sync on Zenodo, and created a release, to archive the repository with agreed scope on Zenodo.

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 58

# Times from today
times = [
    ('15.38', '15.47')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
