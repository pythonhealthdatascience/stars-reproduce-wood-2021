Redid badge evaluation.

:::

## 11.17-11.19: Revisit evaluation

Revisited and revised the badge criteria to (a) make them up-to-date, and (b) make sure they are *specific* to the descriptions from each badge. Hence, redoing evaluations for all eight studies.

Notes:

* reproduce - yes, as troubleshooting was all minor (getting set up with right environment and stuff) - and only require a minor tweak to a plotting function in terms of coding

## Untimed: Update summary report

With new badge evaluation results.
