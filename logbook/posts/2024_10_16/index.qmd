## Untimed: Research compendium

Tried `testthat` in docker following yesterday's fix, and found that it manages to find `scenario` if the function is copied and pasted into `test-model.R` but not when it is sourced (`source("../../scripts/covid_triage_simr.R")`). I tried an alternative approach of having an optional `scen` parameter, which fixed it. Double-checked `main.R` with one of the runs of the loop, which worked fine.

With that fixed, I did the final steps of:

* Setting up the GHCR action
* Completing the reproduction README

This is now ready for (a) consensus from Tom, so can then email the author, and (b) test-run, so can then archive.
