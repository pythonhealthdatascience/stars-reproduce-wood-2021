## 12.13-12.26: Set up environment and copy over files

I created an `.RProj` in `reproduction/`, then looked to the repository and article for any packages and versions.

* Supplementary material: R 3.6.0
* Article: No mention
* Repository: `master.R` has `library(tidyverse)` and `covid_triage_simr.R` has:

```
library(parallel)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
```

As I have had difficulty attempting to backdate R, I will first try this in my current version of R (4.4.1) with the latest packages.

I created a DESCRIPTION file with these packages:

```
Title: Computational reproducibility assessment of Wood et al. 2021
Depends: 
    R
Imports:
    parallel,
    tidyr,
    dplyr,
    ggplot2,
    gridExtra,
    tidyverse
```

I set up the `renv`:

```
renv::init(bare=TRUE)
renv::install()
renv::snapshot()
```

I copied the scripts and inputs into `reproduction/`, but not the original outputs. I reorganised these into `inputs/` and `scripts/` folders.

I looked over the scripts, easily identifying `master.R` (which I renamed to main) as the primary script to run, which itself uses `covid_triage_simr.R` which contains the model code. There were several scripts beginning `fig...` for creating plots from the article, it appears.

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 67

# Times from today
times = [
    ('12.13', '12.26')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
