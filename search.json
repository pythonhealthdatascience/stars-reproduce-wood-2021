I found the total run time was 48.42 hours - so 48 hours 25.2 minutes.\nAs in the article, the simulation was for a 20-bed intensive care unit, but then sensitivity analysis of running ward sizes of 10 to 200 beds. Just looking at the time for 20 beds, that was 2.05 hours - so 2 hours 3 minutes\n\n\nfig4_fig5_fig6_tbl3.R\nAmended file paths (as already set up at start, very handy!) -\nsetwd(\"xxx\")\n\nfolder_name&lt;-\"xxx/results/\"\nAnd also amending the save paths (as those were default to save to current working directory).\nI realised it required outp_raw. I hadn‚Äôt synced all the raw files with GitHub due to their size. I checked the size of the file from capacity 20 and found it was 2.38Gb - far too large to upload! I tried compressing the file:\ngzip -f outp_raw.csv\nThis reduced the size to 129Mb, which is over the file size limit of 100 MiB. I would need to use Git Large File Storage to track this on GitHub. As this is the only raw file required (and doesn‚Äôt require those from sensitivity analysis), I decided to set this up with LFS. To do this I first installed Git LFS:\nsudo apt-get install git-lfs\ngit-lfs install\nAnd then set it up to track:\ngit lfs track \"outp_raw.csv.gz\"\ngit add outp_raw.csv.gz\nHowever, when pulled onto my local machine, I found that the file size was only 1M (unlike on remote machine where the zipped file is 129M). I realised this is because I need to do a specific git fetch for the LFS files.\ngit lfs fetch --all\ngit lfs pull\nI then ran fig4_fig5_fig6_tbl3.R. It was a bit slow to create outp_raw due to the size of the file (so taking about 2/3 mins ish to run the R script).\nI looked over the images, easily confirming at 11.55 that all were reproduced. All of these looked to have been exactly reproduced (with table 3 referring to table 4)."

I also checked the article, but that doesn‚Äôt mention the smoothing.\nI tried a few different smoothing methods - lm, glm, gam (big drop at end).\nI tried setting na.rm=TRUE or FALSE, and fullrange=TRUE, which made no difference.\nI checked the plot without applying facet_grid() and found that it looked correct. Hence, I tried some tweaks to facet grid. I tried making the plots manually/seperately, but the issue remained.\nI filtered the dataset to the Lockdown Deaths for 150+ ICU beds to check the values look correct, and saw no issues - it shouldn‚Äôt be dropping to 0.\nI removed the lines from geom_area(), which then just leaves the smoothed filled areas, and then you find no issue with the lines. Hence, ignoring the absense of a black line, I would then say these to be reproduced, having removed the weird glitch from the line from smoothing."

Based on this previous advice, I decided to mark this as ‚Äúunmet‚Äù for structure as -\n\nNo comments in code or documentation to guide reuse.\nPretty much all parameters are hard-coded - it has been designed for use for this application, and would require a bunch of changes to allow it to be altered without hard coding.\n\nHowever, I did want to commend that it did make efforts to be adaptable to be re-run in different working directories (with setwd() blank at the top, and then getwd() used for later file paths)."

    "text": "This repository is licensed under the [license].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView license\n\n\n\n\n\n                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                   Version 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.¬†https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n                        Preamble\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program‚Äìto make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers‚Äô and authors‚Äô protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users‚Äô and authors‚Äô sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users‚Äô freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nDefinitions.\n\n‚ÄúThis License‚Äù refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n‚ÄúCopyright‚Äù also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n‚ÄúThe Program‚Äù refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as ‚Äúyou‚Äù. ‚ÄúLicensees‚Äù and ‚Äúrecipients‚Äù may be individuals or organizations.\nTo ‚Äúmodify‚Äù a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a ‚Äúmodified version‚Äù of the earlier work or a work ‚Äúbased on‚Äù the earlier work.\nA ‚Äúcovered work‚Äù means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo ‚Äúpropagate‚Äù a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo ‚Äúconvey‚Äù a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays ‚ÄúAppropriate Legal Notices‚Äù to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\nSource Code.\n\nThe ‚Äúsource code‚Äù for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. ‚ÄúObject code‚Äù means any non-source form of a work.\nA ‚ÄúStandard Interface‚Äù means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe ‚ÄúSystem Libraries‚Äù of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A ‚ÄúMajor Component‚Äù, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe ‚ÄúCorresponding Source‚Äù for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work‚Äôs System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\nBasic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\nProtecting Users‚Äô Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work‚Äôs users, your or third parties‚Äô legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\nConveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program‚Äôs source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\nConveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\n\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ‚Äúaggregate‚Äù if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation‚Äôs users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\nConveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA ‚ÄúUser Product‚Äù is either (1) a ‚Äúconsumer product‚Äù, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, ‚Äúnormally used‚Äù refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n‚ÄúInstallation Information‚Äù for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\nAdditional Terms.\n\n‚ÄúAdditional permissions‚Äù are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered ‚Äúfurther restrictions‚Äù within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\nTermination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\nAcceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\nAutomatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn ‚Äúentity transaction‚Äù is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party‚Äôs predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\nPatents.\n\nA ‚Äúcontributor‚Äù is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor‚Äôs ‚Äúcontributor version‚Äù.\nA contributor‚Äôs ‚Äúessential patent claims‚Äù are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor‚Äôs essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a ‚Äúpatent license‚Äù is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To ‚Äúgrant‚Äù such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. ‚ÄúKnowingly relying‚Äù means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient‚Äôs use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is ‚Äúdiscriminatory‚Äù if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\nNo Surrender of Others‚Äô Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\nUse with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\nRevised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License ‚Äúor any later version‚Äù applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy‚Äôs public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\nDisclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\nLimitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nInterpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n                 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ‚Äúcopyright‚Äù line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\nCopyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n&lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands show w' andshow c‚Äô should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program‚Äôs commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an ‚Äúabout box‚Äù.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a ‚Äúcopyright disclaimer‚Äù for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

Where possible provide a citation of the algorithm(s).\n‚úÖ Fully\nThe scenarios are clearly visualised in Figure 1 and described in Methods: Triage Strategies - e.g.¬†‚ÄúThe first strategy accounts for a rigid cutoff, in which no patient is admit- ted to intensive care whose age is above the considered threshold (cutoff strategy). The second strategy relaxes this constraint, to the extent that‚Ä¶‚Äù. Then in Methods: Triage Strategies, ‚Äúactivities were simulated for a 20-bed intensive care unit‚Ä¶ To gauge the sensitivity to different ward sizes, modeling was also performed on ward sizes ranging from 10 to 200 beds‚Äù. Then in Methods: Application, e.g.¬†‚Äú3 demand trajectories for intensive care admission were synthetically generated with the aim of stressing the bed base‚Ä¶‚ÄùWood et al. (2021)\n\n\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1 Base model overview diagram\nDescribe the base model using appropriate diagrams and description. This could include one or more process flow, activity cycle or equivalent diagrams sufficient to describe the model to readers. Avoid complicated diagrams in the main text.

Give additional model logic details sufficient to communicate to the reader how the model works.\n‚úÖ Fully\nFigure 2 and Methods: Model\n\n\n2.3 Scenario logic\nGive details of the logical difference between the base case model and scenarios (if any). This could be incorporated as text or where differences are substantial could be incorporated in the same manner as 2.2.\n‚úÖ Fully\nFigure 1 and Methods: Triage Strategies\n\n\n2.4 Algorithms\nProvide further detail on any algorithms in the model that (for example) mimic complex or manual processes in the real world (i.e.¬†scheduling of arrivals/ appointments/ operations/ maintenance, operation of a conveyor system, machine breakdowns, etc.). Sufficient detail should be included (or referred to in other published work) for the algorithms to be reproducible. Pseudo-code may be used to describe an algorithm.\n‚úÖ Fully\nMethods: Application - e.g.¬†‚ÄúDemand for intensive care admission was generated using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered compartmental model41 developed for use within the COVID-19 setting‚Ä¶‚Äù - and Table 2Wood et al. (2021)\n\n\n2.5.1 Components - entities\nGive details of all entities within the simulation including a description of their role in the model and a description of all their attributes.\n‚úÖ Fully\nPatients with an age - as mentioned in Methods: Application, ‚ÄúPatient groups are defined by the 6 age brackets provided in the weekly reports published by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC)‚Äù and given in Table 1Wood et al.

(2021)\n\n\n2.5.4 Components - queues\nGive details of the assumed queuing discipline used in the model (e.g.¬†First in First Out, Last in First Out, prioritisation, etc.). Where one or more queues have a different discipline from the rest, provide a list of queues, indicating the queuing discipline used for each. If reneging, balking or jockeying occur, etc., provide details of the rules. Detail any delays or capacity constraints on the queues.\n‚úÖ Fully\nAs in Methods, ‚Äúthe modeled queue discipline from the originally assumed ‚Äòfirst-come, first-served‚Äô to allow for the 3 triage strategies outlined in the ‚ÄòTriage Strategies‚Äô section.‚Äù‚Ä¶ and these are then described in Methods: Triage Strategies.Wood et al. (2021)\n\n\n2.5.5 Components - entry/exit points\nGive details of the model boundaries i.e.¬†all arrival and exit points of entities. Detail the arrival mechanism (e.g.¬†‚Äòthinning‚Äô to mimic a non-homogenous Poisson process or balking)\n‚úÖ Fully\nEvident in Figure 1 and Figure 2.\n\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1 Data sources\nList and detail all data sources. Sources may include:‚Ä¢ Interviews with stakeholders,‚Ä¢ Samples of routinely collected data,‚Ä¢ Prospectively collected samples for the purpose of the simulation study,‚Ä¢ Public domain data published in either academic or organisational literature. Provide, where possible, the link and DOI to the data or reference to published literature.All data source descriptions should include details of the sample size, sample date ranges and use within the study.\n‚úÖ Fully\nDescribed in Methods, Table 3 and Supplementary Materials - e.g.¬†‚ÄúPatient groups are defined by the 6 age brackets provided in the weekly reports published by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC; https://www.icnarc.org)‚Äù‚Ä¶ ‚Äúnumber of life-years remaining was calculated as the sex-weighted mean value for each age group using UK national life tables pub- lished by the Office for National Statistics‚ÄùWood et al. (2021)\n\n\n3.2 Pre-processing\nProvide details of any data manipulation that has taken place before its use in the simulation, e.g.¬†interpolation to account for missing data or the removal of outliers.\n‚úÖ Fully\nDescribed in Methods: Application - e.g.¬†generating demand trajectories using the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model as described in Figure 3, and e.g.¬†description ofhow data from different sources is used, like the deduced median and interquartile range used to approprixmate distributions of lengths of stay.Further supported by descriptions in the STRESS-DES checklist in the Supplementary Materials of Wood et al. (2020) (paper with model that Wood et al.¬†2021 built upon).\n\n\n3.3 Input parameters\nList all input variables in the model. Provide a description of their use and include parameter values. For stochastic inputs provide details of any continuous, discrete or empirical distributions used along with all associated parameters. Give details of all time dependent parameters and correlation.Clearly state:‚Ä¢ Base case data‚Ä¢ Data use in experimentation, where different from the base case.‚Ä¢ Where optimisation or design of experiments has been used, state the range of values that parameters can take.‚Ä¢ Where theoretical distributions are used, state how these were selected and prioritised above other candidate distributions.\n‚úÖ Fully\nTable 1, Table 2, Table 3, and other/supporting descriptions in Methods and Supplementary Materials.\n\n\n3.4 Assumptions\nWhere data or knowledge of the real system is unavailable what assumptions are included in the model? This might include parameter values, distributions or routing logic within the model.\n‚úÖ Fully\nMentioned throughout paper - e.g.¬†‚ÄúThe probability that a patient will die if not admitted to inten- sive care was assumed uniform across all patient groups‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt was assumed‚Äîin absence of available data‚Äî that patients discharged prematurely, at any number of days postadmission, had the same probability of death‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚ÄúA key assumption of the interrupt strategy has been that a patient may be prematurely discharged at any number of days after admission‚Ä¶‚ÄùWood et al. (2021)\n\n\nExperimentation\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1 Initialisation\nReport if the system modelled is terminating or non-terminating. State if a warm-up period has been used, its length and the analysis method used to select it. For terminating systems state the stopping condition.State what if any initial model conditions have been included, e.g., pre-loaded queues and activities. Report whether initialisation of these variables is deterministic or stochastic.\n‚úÖ Fully\nCouldn‚Äôt spot mention in this paper, but it does state in the paper and supplementary materials that this is based on a previous model (and then describes the specific modifications made from that model). As such, in line with previous evaluations (where we have assumed the information can be provided in an earlier paper, as long as they would not have changed in the current paper), I checked the prior paper for this detail, and it does state: ‚Äúevents are iterated in line with the three-phased method until some terminating criterion is met. Here, this is given by the time at which some outcome has been reached for all simulated admissions for the given epidemic curve (for cases requiring intensive care admission), i.e.¬†each sought admission has been either rejected or admitted and discharged or died (event types c-f)‚ÄùWood et al. (2020)\n\n\n4.2 Run length\nDetail the run length of the simulation model and time units.\n‚úÖ Fully\nAs stated in the STRESS-DES checklist in the Supplementary Materials of Wood et al. (2020) (paper with model that Wood et al.¬†2021 built upon), ‚ÄúDetermined by the stopping condition outlined in 4.1 of this checklist.‚Äù\n\n\n4.3 Estimation approach\nState the method used to account for the stochasticity: For example, two common methods are multiple replications or batch means. Where multiple replications have been used, state the number of replications and for batch means, indicate the batch length and whether the batch means procedure is standard, spaced or overlapping. For both procedures provide a justification for the methods used and the number of replications/size of batches.\n‚úÖ Fully\nSupplementary materials - 1000 replications. This is justified in prior paper in 2.4 Simulation: ‚ÄúThis number of replications was selected based on the resulting reduction of simulation error to magnitudes deemed sufficiently negligible (&lt;0.25%) when assessed against the output measures of interest (this was performed using different seeds for which the random number streams were drawn for each replication within the simulations considered).‚ÄùWood et al. (2020)\n\n\nImplementation\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Software or programming language\nState the operating system and version and build number.State the name, version and build number of commercial or open source DES software that the model is implemented in.State the name and version of general-purpose programming languages used (e.g.¬†Python 3.5).Where frameworks and libraries have been used provide all details including version numbers.\nüü° Partially\nSupplementary materials - ‚ÄúAll simulations were performed on a Windows 10 desktop computer using 64-bit R version 3.6.0.Doesn‚Äôt given libraries and their versions.Wood et al. (2021)\n\n\n5.2 Random sampling\nState the algorithm used to generate random samples in the software/programming language used e.g.¬†Mersenne Twister.If common random numbers are used, state how seeds (or random number streams) are distributed among sampling processes.\n‚úÖ Fully\nSupplementary Materials: ‚ÄúIn order to appreciate the many other possibilities a number of ‚Äòreplications‚Äô are performed, each drawing upon different random number streams for sampling the various probabilities and lengths of stay.‚ÄùWood et al. (2021) Further supported by descriptions in the STRESS-DES checklist in the Supplementary Materials of Wood et al. (2020) - ‚ÄúUses the inbuilt random number generator in R. Each replication uses a different seed call to this function.‚Äù\n\n\n5.3 Model execution\nState the event processing mechanism used e.g.¬†three phase, event, activity, process interaction.Note that in some commercial software the event processing mechanism may not be published. In these cases authors should adhere to item 5.1 software recommendations.State all priority rules included if entities/activities compete for resources.If the model is parallel, distributed and/or use grid or cloud computing, etc., state and preferably reference the technology used. For parallel and distributed simulations the time management algorithms used. If the HLA is used then state the version of the standard, which run-time infrastructure (and version), and any supporting documents (FOMs, etc.)\n‚úÖ Fully\nThree phase, described in detail in 2.1 Model and STRESS-DES checklist in supplementary materials of Wood et al. (2020)\n\n\n5.4 System specification\nState the model run time and specification of hardware used. This is particularly important for large scale models that require substantial computing power. For parallel, distributed and/or use grid or cloud computing, etc. state the details of all systems used in the implementation (processors, network, etc.)\nüü° Partially\nStated run time in this paper and prior, and explains why hardware is not relevant in prior - ‚ÄúProcessing time is insubstantial, typically taking less than five minutes for each scenario evaluated on a desktop computer (note that scenarios with larger projections of number of admissions than those considered here take longer due to more ‚Äúdiscrete events‚Äù taking place). Computational constraints are on processing time and not computer memory.‚Äù (Wood et al. (2020)). However, given that I found the model took 48 hours to run, I feel this description would benefit from mentioning that, and feels incomplete.\n\n\nCode access\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1 Computer model sharing statement\nDescribe how someone could obtain the model described in the paper, the simulation software and any other associated software (or hardware) needed to reproduce the results. Provide, where possible, the link and DOIs to these.\n‚úÖ Fully\nResearch Data - ‚ÄúThe data sets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available in the ‚Äòtriage-modelling‚Äô repository, https://github.com/nhs-bnssg-analytics/triage-modelling.‚Äù Wood et al. (2021)"

Moreover, we focus only on reproduction of the discrete-event simulation, and not on other aspects of the article. We cannot guarantee that the badges below would have been awarded in practice by these journals."

I didn‚Äôt end up needing to dig into the code much as it ran pretty easily, but if I had needed to, this would have been more of an issue.\n\nMinimise output file sizes if possible\n\nThe large file sizes for outp_raw.csv were difficult to work with, as it required that I compress it (.csv.gz) set up GitHub Large File Storage to track. Gladly only one of the twenty raw results files was needed for the analysis. If there were any way this results file could be shrinked (for example, if there‚Äôs any information not actually needed, or so on), this would be handy."

(3)\nRE: Versions, did not attempt to back-date due to previous issues trying to do this. (3)\nInstead, used latest versions of R and packages. Based package imports on library() statements, which required checking across all the .R files to spot them. (3)\n\n\n\nFile paths\n\nAmended file paths for imports and exports (as I reorganised repository). (3,4)\n\n\n\nSyncing raw results file\n\nThe outp_raw.csv needed to be compressed to .csv.gz and set up with GitHub Large File Storage in order to sync it with GitHub and get it onto my local machine so I could process the results. (4)\n\n\n\nCorrection to figure\n\nFor figure 7, the provided script didn‚Äôt include smoothing of the lines. Although I could easily add this by setting stat=\"smooth\" in geom_area(), it created a weird dip in the charts that looks like a bug (as the underlying data has no issues). I decided the removing the black outline was the simplest solution to this. (4)"
